ASSIGNMENT DETAILS:
Grocery Store Inventory Management

In this project-based assignment, you will create a Python program for managing the inventory of a grocery store. This will involve handling variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, and loops.

Task Description:

You are tasked with creating a Python program that allows a grocery store manager to:

-Add new items to the inventory.
-Update existing items' quantities.
-View the current inventory.
-Remove items from the inventory.

Project Requirements:

1. Variables, Data Types, and Operators:

-Define variables to store information about the items in the inventory, such as item name, quantity, and price. Ensure appropriate data types are used (e.g., strings, integers, floats).
-Implement basic arithmetic operations for updating item quantities.

2. Control Structures:

-Use conditional statements to handle user input and perform the appropriate action based on the selected menu option (if, elif, else).
-Utilize loops to allow the manager to perform multiple actions in a single session (e.g., update quantities for multiple items).
